# Examples for pinpit using Gradle

This repository contains a few examples on how to configure
[pinpit](https://github.com/mobanisto/pinpit-gradle-plugin) for
Gradle-based builds.

There are examples for the classic Groovy-based DSL in the `groovy`
directory as well as examples for the Kotlin-based DSL in the `kotlin`
directory.

For each DSL, there are currently two examples:
* swing-helloworld - a simple GUI application with a Swing UI.
* compose-helloworld - a simple GUI application with a Compose UI.

For the Kotlin DSL, there are additional examples:
* readme - the projects used for the [pinpit](https://github.com/mobanisto/pinpit-gradle-plugin)
  project's main README file.
* compose-mpp - a Kotlin multiplatform project that has a common
  Compose UI and both and Android and a desktop application configured.
